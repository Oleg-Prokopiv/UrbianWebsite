                  At some point, every smart business gets to a place where it
                  needs to disrupt itself. Whether it is implementing a new HR
                  system to motivate and inspire staff, or introducing a new
                  app, product or service to stay relevant in the market: every
                  business reaches a stage where deep-seated change is
                  imperative for growth. Sometimes, failure to change leads to
                  failure to succeed, as the now famous examples of Kodak and
                  Blackberry brands have demonstrated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For many years business leaders have sought to understand and
                  implement this change with the help of outside consultancies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Big name change management and advisory firms are brought in
                  to identify where the weaknesses lie, and to chart a way
                  forward for the business in its respective market sector. This
                  process usually takes months, involves plenty of number
                  crunching, face-to-face interviews, painstaking research and
                  ongoing analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At the end though, businesses are presented with text-heavy
                  tomes that present a highly detailed analysis of the current
                  scenario, coupled with specific suggestions on how and where
                  changes need to be made. This authoritative tome comes at
                  great expense to the business or client, and the consultancy
                  exits… having met the brief.

                <h2>Meet the makers</h2>
                <p>
                  However, in an environment that is dominated by digital
                  innovation and ongoing disruption, the brief is changing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Savvy businesses are recognising that they can no longer
                  afford to wait for a consultancy to conduct a six-month
                  analysis. Moreover, once businesses receive the normal
                  100-page tome, chances are their particular industry or market
                  has already moved on to the next trend or wave of innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In short, the digital sphere is moving far too quickly for the
                  traditional consultancy model to have any kind of immediate
                  and meaningful impact. As a result, a new type of
                  ‘consultancy’ is fast emerging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unlike its predecessors, the new breed is characterised by
                  speed and the ability to implement change quickly. It is also
                  characterised by the ability to build something — usually in
                  the form of a digital product or service. Instead of the
                  laborious and painstaking research that consultancies conduct,
                  the real work happens in short bursts — incorporating new
                  methodologies such as design thinking, lean start-up
                  methodology, design sprints and agile software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The entire process can happen within a month, and the business
                  or client is left with an actual product or service — such as
                  an app or streamlined e-commerce platform.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With this new consulting model, it is possible to get an
                  actual product or service, such as an app or streamlined
                  e-commerce platform out in a month, and they continue to
                  validate assumptions with real people, continually refining
                  the outcomes collaboratively with the business. The difference
                  in delivery is that stakeholders are giving feedback on
                  working prototypes rather than theoretical offerings set out
                  in pretty presentation decks.
                </p>

                <h2>Designing, developing… doing</h2>
                <p>
                  Whether this process happens with the help of an outside
                  digital or innovation specialist, or by hiring internally to
                  implement change, the key point is that ‘thinking’ is being
                  joined by ‘doing’ or ‘making’. Gone are the days when
                  businesses could chew on theories and ideas for months… today,
                  change and innovation has to happen quickly and efficiently.
                  It also has to produce something tangible and immediately
                  relevant to customers and employees.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response, smart business leaders are adjusting the
                  structure and makeup of their organisations to reflect this
                  status quo. The most successful businesses are lean, agile,
                  and able to pivot within months. They are designed for
                  innovation, and to be proactive instead of reactive within
                  their respective markets. Importantly, futureproof businesses
                  also take their cue from their customers and end users —
                  instead of a far removed third party ‘expert’.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Not only is this new way of working and progressing more
                  efficient, but it is also far more cost effective. With the
                  new model of innovation, and the new wave of dynamic
                  innovators, businesses are entering an enticing phase of
                  creative freedom, efficiency and true empowerment.
